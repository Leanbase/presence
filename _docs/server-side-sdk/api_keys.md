When any one of our server side SDKs open up a connection with leanbase's servers, they must identify and authenticate the team which creates and manages their features. This identification and authentication process is handled by using an API Key. The API Key is available on your team's settings page.

Here's how to obtain it:

1. Go to your the [leanbase app](https://app.leanbase.io/)
2. Click on the profile icon at the top right
3. In the newly opened flyout, click on the settings menu item
4. Click 'Copy' to copy your API key to the clipboard
