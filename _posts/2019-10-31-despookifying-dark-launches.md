So what are dark launches? Are they spooky? Can they help your team increase their speed of delivery? <!--more-->

Do you feel butterflies in your stomach when you are shipping out a large change to your application? You've spent months ironing out features, chasing down bugs, debating API specs. Now, finally, the day has arrived. The trepidation, and the anxiety starts to build when the upstream services are deployed. Your team starts tailing the logs to see if anything broke.

Is all of this stress really necessary? Do we need to orchestrate all the teams to deploy together? Isn't the release date the worst time to surface bugs?

With continous delivery now taking off, product teams can reduce their stress, increase the reliability of their systems and push out more features, faster.

A dark launch is where you let a small group of users (chosen or random) have access to a feature _before_ the feature is available to all users.

You could be doing this for a variety of reasons:

Maybe you are not sure your infrastructure can handle the new feature. So, you gradually expose it to more traffic.

Maybe you want to test the feature out with your staff, so you only want to give them access.

Maybe, and here's where it gets really interesting, you want to see if the feature or change actually has the effect you believe it will. Like increase conversion rates. So, you expose only a few users to it and test your hypothesis.

Dark launches are an important tool in any product team's arsenal. If you work on cloud based software, dark launch systems make your software more reliable, your deliveries speedier and more in line with what helps your customers.
