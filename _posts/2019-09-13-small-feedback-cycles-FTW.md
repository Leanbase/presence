How long does it take for you to lose interest in your idea? How long if it was someone else's? What is the cost of having a low learning rate?

It is crucial to reduce the time it takes for your tests to return results.

# The grand purpose of ideas

As long as your team has _some_ goals, they *are* coming up with ideas for it. Most ideas are not that great, and that is.... okay. Ideas will not yield results. The *learning* from _trying out_ those ideas will. Results will help *uncover* better **spaces** for future ideas.

# Learning rate

You need to be able to evaluate a larger number of ideas per day or week or month. That is what I call **learning rate**.  Someone comes up with an idea. You identify the key assumptions. And then, you test them. In the open: on your customers.... A low learning rate ends up reinforcing HiPPPO ([Highest Paid Person's Opinion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/#487e060880f9)). If you want to assess your learning rate, try figuring out who makes decisions. If it is usually a few key people, you have a low learning rate. If it is a broader set of people, decisive power is shared and you have a high learning rate. A low learning rate is accompanied by long feedback cycles. A long feedback cycle stifles innovation.

> Time passes and attention shifts, and when feedback finally arrives, momentum is lost, the link between the cause and effect is severed, and project decisions have been made. <i style="float: right; font-size: 0.6em;">&mdash; Stefan Thomke in <a target="1" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nM-5IWBGhoEC&lpg=PP1&dq=experimentation%20matters&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=experimentation%20matters&f=false">Experimentation Matters</a></i>

With a high learning rate, you encourage your colleagues to make decisions and learn from their outcomes. They are far more engaged and can *reason*. The brainstorms are now backed by data. 

> They start forming their own intuitions.

*That* is invaluable. You end up with so many diverse ideas... so many people who care. This is because they are building things on their own. 

# Learning by experimentation is cyclical

Research has shown that [experiential learning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning) is more effective[^1] when there is a cyclical pattern of previous experience followed by thought and reflection (active experimentation).

Learning by experimentation can help deliver _just_ that. A cyclical process of manipulating variables, quick feedback, thought and brainstorm to find out the cause and absorbing that as knowledge.

Each experimentation cycle is rotating the crank once. And with it, your team's knowledge is stepped up, elevated. What can you do with this knowledge, you ask? Anything! Knowledge is power. Know more than your competitors, you'll outlast them.

# Striving to a more adaptive team

Learning by cycles has another effect. It makes your team resilient and adaptive in the face of changes. Both good and bad.

If your team is setup to rapidly experiment and learn, and an idea takes off, they are ready to put more energy behind it. They can refine the idea and extract the maximal value out of it within a few feedback cycles.

On the other hand, say a new competitor enters the market and starts chewing off key customers from you. Within a few feedback cycles, they have tried out a large number of ways to retain customers and figured out the ones that work best (or atleast suck the least).

The key to survive as a startup, and to flourish as an organization is to adapt and be ready for everything. Working on your learning rate does just that!

How can you make your team learn more every week?
