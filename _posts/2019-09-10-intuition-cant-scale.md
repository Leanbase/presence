You have studied your market for years now. Had interviews with so many customers, you can't remember their names. Found a niche and developed a product addressing their needs. You _intuitively_ know what is right. What will click, what will bomb... But does your team understand?

Naturally, *they* do not have the same experience as you. They worked in different markets, their clientele has changed over the years. They have a broader, but not a deeper understanding of the people you are serving. You wonder why they do not, yet, share your intuition. You wonder how to make them see your side.

Here's the thing: Only if you share context routinely, the team's intuitions will converge over time. That means, shared meetings, shadowed or recorded calls, reports, talks etc. *Communication*. Communication is key. As I [and others](https://www.effectiveengineer.com/blog/communication-first-casualty-of-teams-growth) have observed, though, communication is the first casualty of growth. So, as your team grows, sharing context becomes harder and more ineffective.

## Find some other way to convey context

Experiments. Experimentation is process. It is *not* context. If you create a framework for experimentation... if you make experiments the __default__ way of communicating, you are letting your team learn more, faster. As they learn, and so do you, the contexts materalize and converge quicker. Intuition is great for strategy, but poor for execution. Power your team to make decisions and communicate based on data. You'll find that the new intuition, distributed in so many heads is so much better! The whole is more than the sum of parts.

Move your team to experimenting. Make _that_ the way you conduct business. You'll find the team learns faster, and maybe you'll discover, your intuition needs some tweaks too! Cheers!
